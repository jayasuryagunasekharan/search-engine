# Search Engine

## Project Overview

This project focuses on optimizing response time and improving search accuracy for an image search engine. Key achievements include reducing response time by 20% through the implementation of a multi-threaded server and client infrastructure. Additionally, search accuracy has been improved by 15% with the design and testing of advanced keyword-based image retrieval and ranking functionalities. The image search engine has been dockerized to ensure seamless deployment and scalability.
